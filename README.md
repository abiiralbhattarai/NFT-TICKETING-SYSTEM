# NFT TICKETING SYSTEM

### It is a project that I did for one my clients. In this project I did following things

- Utilized the cutting-edge RMRK NFT 2.0 standard to create unique and easily transferable digital tickets.
- Implemented Chainlink's decentralized oracle solution for secure and reliable off-chain data retrieval. Also developed the [contract](https://github.com/abiiralbhattarai/chainLinknode-Whitelisting) to whitelist requesters.
- Incorporated Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) mechanisms to enhance security and provide various permission levels
- Employed contract upgradeability patterns to ensure that the NFT ticketing system remains adaptable and can evolve to meet future needs without disrupting existing functionality.
- Outlined a roadmap for future enhancements and features, including integration with emerging blockchain technologies and additional functionalities like dynamic pricing and ticket bundling.
